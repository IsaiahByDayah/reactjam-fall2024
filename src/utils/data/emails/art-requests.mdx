Hello <FirstName />,

Welcome to the team! I missed you at the standup because I work remote in the morning and come into the office after lunch. I’ll be pretty heads down the rest of the day but I wanted to let you know we’re available for art requests so if you have any ideas send me a message. I can get you a mock-up pretty quickly (perfect for a meeting visual!), just remember final drafts are more time-intensive.
