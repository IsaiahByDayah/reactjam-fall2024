Hey Pack Hey!

Whether it’s the dog days of summer or the stressful excitement of the Blazin Hot Twirly Whirls™ joining the pack (Muy Yum!), we all need a pick me up every now and then! And no it can’t just be the crunchtastic tastes of muy.

My official title is Office Administrator but my unofficial title is Morale Booster!

Anyway, this is going exactly where you’d expect it to. That’s right! A call for Pet Photos!

Send in a photo of your pet for this season’s pet slide show! Bonus points if your pet is styling in summer clothes or enjoying some hot weather activities.

Reminder: no fear-inducing friends please! (ex. Snakes, spiders, etc)

Happy Monday!
